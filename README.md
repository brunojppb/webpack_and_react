## Learning React - Building a Kanban web app with React.js and Webpack

Looking for a good resource to learn React.js, I have found this great book: [SurviveJS].
From the start point, it teaches you what is [Webpack] and how it plays with your Javascript code. It also shows a great comparison among the most used Module Mundlers.

Following along the book, the author will create a kamban app from scratch, teaching how React concepts works like components are the new hot thing. It shows how the Facebook architecture called FLUX works as well.

#### Requirements
- [Node.js]
- [npm]

#### How to run the project?

- clone the project:
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:brunojppb/webpack_and_react.git
```

```
the server will be running on port 8080
